# Marketing-Sales-Analytics-Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to provide a comprehensive, 360-degree view of a business's marketing and sales performance. This solution integrates marketing campaign data, sales figures, and customer feedback to offer a holistic understanding of market dynamics, campaign effectiveness, and customer sentiment.

**The Business Challenge**

In today's competitive market, businesses often struggle to connect their marketing efforts directly to sales outcomes. Data is frequently siloed, making it difficult to answer critical questions such as:

Which marketing campaigns are most effective at driving sales?

How are market trends impacting our performance?

What is the current sentiment of our customers, and how does it relate to sales?

Are our marketing campaigns aligning with product demand and customer demographics?

This project aims to bridge these data gaps and provide a single source of truth for making data-driven strategic decisions.

**Project Goal & User Stories**

The primary goal of this project is to create an integrated analytics solution that enables key stakeholders to:

Monitor and analyze the performance of marketing campaigns.

Understand market trends and their impact on sales.

Gain insights into customer demographics and behavior.

Correlate customer sentiment with product reviews.


**Data Journey & Technical Architecture**

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline, showcasing proficiency across multiple stages of data management:

Data Sourcing & Storage: The project's data is housed in a SQL Server database, which includes tables for customers, products, sales, and marketing campaigns.

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): SQL queries were used directly within Power BI to extract and transform the data, demonstrating proficiency in database querying.

Sentiment Analysis: Customer reviews were processed using Python. The sentiment analysis was performed in a Python script, which then provided the sentiment-categorized data for the dashboard.

Data Modeling & Visualization: Microsoft Power BI was used to connect to the SQL Database and the sentiment data. The dashboard visualizes key metrics and provides interactive filtering capabilities.
